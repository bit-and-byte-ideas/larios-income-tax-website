2. [ ] Verify deployment token is valid
3. [ ] Check Azure Static Web App status
4. [ ] Review Terraform state
5. [ ] Retry deployment if transient error
6. [ ] Rollback to previous release if needed
7. [ ] Document issue and resolution

### Security Incident

1. [ ] Rotate all credentials immediately:
   - [ ] Service principal credentials
   - [ ] Deployment tokens
   - [ ] GitHub secrets
2. [ ] Review access logs in Azure
3. [ ] Check for unauthorized changes
4. [ ] Review GitHub audit log
5. [ ] Notify security team
6. [ ] Document incident
7. [ ] Update security procedures

### State File Corruption

## Cost Monitoring Checklist

### Monthly Cost Review

- [ ] Development environment: $0/month (Free tier)
- [ ] Production environment: ~$9/month (Standard tier)
- [ ] Total should be ~$9/month
- [ ] Check bandwidth usage (100 GB included, $0.15/GB overage)
- [ ] Review unexpected charges
- [ ] Verify cost savings vs. previous architecture (90% reduction)

### Cost Optimization

- [ ] Free tier for development (current configuration)
- [ ] Monitor production bandwidth usage
- [ ] Review Application Insights retention (90 days)
- [ ] Check for unused resources
- [ ] Consider downgrade to Free tier for non-critical prod if traffic is low

## Migration Checklist (From App Services)

If migrating from Docker-based App Services:

- [ ] Review [MIGRATION.md](../deploy/MIGRATION.md) documentation
- [ ] Backup current App Service configuration
- [ ] Archive old Docker files (.old extension)
- [ ] Update GitHub workflows
- [ ] Test Static Web Apps deployment in dev first
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Update DNS if using custom domain
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates migrate correctly
- [ ] Decommission old App Services resources
- [ ] Update documentation references

## Notes

- Keep this checklist updated as your deployment evolves
- Document any deviations or custom configurations
- Share learnings with the team
- Regular reviews improve reliability
- Static Web Apps deployment is simpler than App Services - no Docker management required
- Deployment tokens should be treated as sensitive credentials
