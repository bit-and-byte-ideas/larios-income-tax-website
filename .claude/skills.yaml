      2. Generate the component using Angular CLI:
         - Use `ng generate component` with appropriate flags
         - Include component.spec.ts file
         - Use SCSS for styles

      3. Follow Angular best practices:
         - Use OnPush change detection if applicable
         - Implement proper lifecycle hooks
         - Add JSDoc comments for public methods

      4. Create basic test setup in the spec file

      5. Update the module imports if not standalone

           ├── components/
           ├── services/
           ├── models/
           ├── <feature-name>.module.ts
           ├── <feature-name>-routing.module.ts
